# **Bayesian Community Detection in Assortative Stochastic Block Models** 

Bayesian community detection in networks using Gibbs sampling under an assortative Stochastic Block Model to enhance clustering accuracy and robustness.

## 📘**Overview**

Community detection aims to identify groups of nodes in a network that are more densely connected internally than with other groups.
This project compares:
Standard SBM – no structural constraints.
Assortative SBM – enforces 
𝑃𝑎𝑎>𝑃𝑎𝑏

**A Bayesian inference framework with Gibbs sampling is used to estimate:**

.Community assignments (z)

.Edge probabilities (P)

.Community proportions (θ)

.Assortativity threshold (τ)


## 🧠**Key Features**

.Bayesian formulation with Dirichlet and Beta priors

.Gibbs sampling algorithm for posterior inference

.Monte Carlo simulations to compare Standard vs. Assortative SBM

.Evaluation with Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)

.Visualizations: boxplots, histograms, τ distributions, and performance scatterplots

## 📂**Files**

.report.pdf – Full project report, including theory, results, and discussion

.code.R – Complete R implementation (network generation, Gibbs sampling, evaluation, and visualization)

## ⚙️**How to Run**

.Install R dependencies:

.install.packages(c("igraph", "parallel", "ggplot2"))

.Run the main R script:

.source("code.R")

.The script automatically:

.Generates synthetic networks

.Runs Gibbs sampling for both models

.Computes ARI metrics

.Produces visual comparisons
